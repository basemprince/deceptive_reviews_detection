That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.\"\n 'The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.'\n 'I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don\\'t know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn\\'t be signing another lease, essentially leaving me \"pre-homeless\". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I\\'m quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me \"pre-unemployed\". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I\\'m finally choosing my path, I\\'m hitting bottom. I\\'m giving up. Shit maybe I\\'m Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the \"Hotel Tokyo\". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I\\'m going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I\\'ll need help, I\\'ll need guidance.'\n ...\n \"Sutton Place is a very elegant hotel. The room and staff were excellent. Room service did a spectacular job cleaning the room while I was away. The bed was a little harder than expected, but still comfortable. If I'm ever in the area again, this would be the hotel I would stay at.\"\n 'The only great thing is location. Rest of the hotel is very forgettable, lacks any character. Decor is stuck in the 90s. Their customer service is extremely poor. After our stay, we checked out and left the hotel for 1 hour. We then realized my husband left his wedding ring on bedside table, so returned immediately to get it. The room had just been cleaned, and I went in and the ring was gone. The person who cleaned it said it wasn\\'t there, but I know exactly where it was, and it was there. So it was stolen. The hotel launched an \"investigation\" where they determined that they were not at fault, and send me a letter letting me know that they would be doing nothing. So we stayed in a mediocre hotel, and lost a wedding ring. All in all, not a way to treat your customers. If you stay here, hide your valuables.'\n 'Noise, noise, noise! Unbelievable! Between the overly loud music and the tons of loud motorcylces, people screaming - this is ridiculous!'].\nReshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.",

That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.\"\n 'The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.'\n 'I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don\\'t know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn\\'t be signing another lease, essentially leaving me \"pre-homeless\". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I\\'m quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me \"pre-unemployed\". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I\\'m finally choosing my path, I\\'m hitting bottom. I\\'m giving up. Shit maybe I\\'m Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the \"Hotel Tokyo\". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I\\'m going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I\\'ll need help, I\\'ll need guidance.'\n ...\n \"Sutton Place is a very elegant hotel. The room and staff were excellent. Room service did a spectacular job cleaning the room while I was away. The bed was a little harder than expected, but still comfortable. If I'm ever in the area again, this would be the hotel I would stay at.\"\n 'The only great thing is location. Rest of the hotel is very forgettable, lacks any character. Decor is stuck in the 90s. Their customer service is extremely poor. After our stay, we checked out and left the hotel for 1 hour. We then realized my husband left his wedding ring on bedside table, so returned immediately to get it. The room had just been cleaned, and I went in and the ring was gone. The person who cleaned it said it wasn\\'t there, but I know exactly where it was, and it was there. So it was stolen. The hotel launched an \"investigation\" where they determined that they were not at fault, and send me a letter letting me know that they would be doing nothing. So we stayed in a mediocre hotel, and lost a wedding ring. All in all, not a way to treat your customers. If you stay here, hide your valuables.'\n 'Noise, noise, noise! Unbelievable! Between the overly loud music and the tons of loud motorcylces, people screaming - this is ridiculous!'].\nReshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample."
